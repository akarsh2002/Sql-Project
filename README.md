# Sql-Project

I'm working on a project with the Chinook Database, which has info about a music store. The team needs help understanding media, customers, employees, and invoices. I'll use the provided schema to navigate and analyze the data.

# Setting up the database 
Let's get the database ready with these steps:

Open DB Browser to SQLite.
Click "Open Database."
Locate the Chinook.db file, typically in your downloads.
Click "Execute SQL."
Now you're set to start querying your data!
